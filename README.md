   - This study has identified the bigger picture of DL methods for crack identification in asphalt pavement. The authors evaluated several DL-based crack identification algorithms from the literature, such as crack classification, crack object detection, pixel-level crack segmentation, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for crack segmentation, and crack identification using unsupervised learning. Moreover, 26 DL-based crack detection models (25 supervised learning models and one unsupervised learning model) were analysed on the same dataset to test the performance of each model using consistent assessment metrics. The testing results suggest that ResNet and DenseNet are the best options for crack classification, while Faster R-CNN should be used for crack object detection and pix2pix is suggested for crack segmentation. It is also recommended that semi-supervised and unsupervised learning be further studied to efficiently detect cracks in an asphalt pavement.

1. **AEL: Automatic Crack Detection on Two-Dimensional Pavement Images: An Algorithm Based on Minimal Path Selection**, *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, 2016.  [[Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7572082)]

   - This paper proposes a new algorithm for automatic crack detection from 2D pavement images. It strongly relies on the localization of minimal paths within each image, a path being a series of neighboring pixels and its score being the sum of their intensities. The originality of the approach stems from the proposed way to select a set of minimal paths and the two postprocessing steps introduced to improve the quality of the detection.

   - The CrackNet, an efficient architecture based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed in this article for automated pavement crack detection on 3D asphalt surfaces with explicit objective of pixel-perfect accuracy. Unlike the commonly used CNN, CrackNet does not have any pooling layers which downsize the outputs of previous layers.
   - The input data of the CrackNet are feature maps generated by the feature extractor using the proposed line filters with various orientations, widths, and lengths. The output of CrackNet is the set of predicted class scores for all pixels.

   - This paper proposes an improved architecture of CrackNet called CrackNet II for enhanced learning capability and faster performance. The proposed CrackNet II represents two major modifications on the original CrackNet.

Consequently, all layers in CrackNet II have learnable parameters that are tuned during the learning process. Second, CrackNet II has a deeper architecture with more hidden layers but fewer parameters.
   - Compared with the original CrackNet, CrackNet II is capable of detecting more fine or hairline cracks, while eliminating more local noises and maintaining much faster processing speed.

   - this paper proposes a patch-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation network for crack detection. The proposed method uses image-level annotation as the supervision condition and fully considers the local similarity of the crack topology in the image. The use of patches cropped from the image as the input in this method can reduce the image complexity significantly without losing the spatial location information of the crack.
   - A discriminative localization technique is used to extract rough location information of the crack from a trained classification network, which is then refined by a conditional random field (DenseCRF) to obtain a synthetic label. These synthetic labels can replace the manually annotated pixel-level labels for the training of the segmentation network. Thereafter, a neighborhood fusion strategy is used to merge the patches into the final output.
   - reducing the annotation workload by approximately 80%

   - we propose a novel Weakly-Supervised hybrid network with multi-attention, termed CGTr-Net, for pavement crack detection.
   - Aiming at alleviating the loss of information, behaving well in extracting both local and global features, the architecture of the backbone CG-Trans was designed. It is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is expert in extracting local features but experiencing difficulties to capture global representations, and Gated axial Transformer, whose gated position-sensitive axial attention mechanism can efficiently extract long-distance feature dependencies but deteriorate in capturing local feature details.
   - To enhance feature fusion between the Transformer Layer and the Convolution Layer, a feature fusion module (TCFF) was added to this network. The two feature maps obtained from Transformer and CNN are utilized to generate Grad-CAM. Subsequently, we use Conditional Random Field (CRF) to further refine the Grad-CAM and adapt Affinity from Attention (AFA), which learn semantic affinity from the Gated Axial Transformer and the Convolutional Neural Network, to produce more accurate pseudo labels.

The information flow in the samples is utilized to invert and eliminate the checkerboard noise produced during integration spatially; in the third stage, a dynamic range compression mechanism is employed to augment the prominence of the cracked areas by compressing the highlighted regions in the saliency map and diminishing the influence of background noise.

   - Our work proposes a weakly supervised approach that leverages a CNN classifier in a novel way to create surface crack pseudo labels. First, we use the classifier to create a rough crack localization map by using its class activation maps and a patch based classification approach and fuse this with a thresholding based approach to segment the mostly darker crack pixels. The classifier assists in suppressing noise from the background regions, which commonly are incorrectly highlighted as cracks by standard thresholding methods. Then, the pseudo labels can be used in an end-to-end approach when training a standard CNN for surface crack segmentation.
   - Our method is shown to yield sufficiently accurate pseudo labels.Those labels, incorporated into segmentation CNN training using multiple recent crack segmentation architectures, achieve comparable performance to fully supervised methods on four popular crack segmentation datasets.

### Few shot

1. **A Few-Shot Attention Recurrent Residual U-Net for Crack Segmentation**, *ISVC*, 2023.  [[Paper Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-47969-4_16)]

   - Recent studies indicate that deep learning plays a crucial role in the automated visual inspection of road infrastructures. However, current learning schemes are static, implying no dynamic adaptation to users’ feedback.
   - To address this drawback, we present a few-shot learning paradigm for the automated segmentation of road cracks, which is based on a U-Net architecture with recurrent residual and attention modules (R2AU-Net). The retraining strategy dynamically fine-tunes the weights of the U-Net as a few new rectified samples are being fed into the classifier.

   - Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings. However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes. In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.
   - we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to learn a unified illumination-invariant representation. Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem. In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set. Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes. CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.
   - Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation

   - This study proposes a novel cycle-consistency-constrained few-shot segmentation framework tailored for multi-type structural damage recognition. A cycle-consistency-constrained prototype learning paradigm is constructed to enhance the adequate utilization of limited pixel-level annotations, which is leveraged by establishing a bidirectional mutual supervision mechanism between support and query sets.
   - Subsequently, a non-parametric similarity-guided optimization module is incorporated into the high-level latent feature space of image embedding. This module induces a similarity-driven contrast learning process for each pixel of feature maps and learns universal prototypes that condense the abstract semantic context of foreground (i.e., multi-type damage) and background.
   - Furthermore, a synthetic loss function, which comprises mutually supervised segmentation dice loss, metric loss, and contrastive loss, is designed to ensure the bidirectional pixel-level segmentation accuracy, intra-class compactness, and inter-class separability of learned prototypes for multi-type damage

   - In this work, a lightweight suspected defect screening network (SDSNet) based on transfer learning is proposed to filter out redundant nondefect samples. Besides, to overcome the comprehensive sparsity of AST defect samples, we introduce a granularity-transfer few-shot defect segmentation (FSDS) based on meta-learning.

Specifically, a defect-aware module (DAM) is employed to activate spatial and channel responses of defect regions, and a lightweight multiscale aggregation decoder (MAD) is used to capture context information at different feature scales.
   - In addition, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline and overcome the practical challenge of AST defect segmentation, a dedicated database is constructed.

   - This study proposes a task-aware meta-learning paradigm using limited images for universal structural damage segmentation.

   - This paper proposes a self-supervised structure learning network which can be trained without using paired data, even without using ground truths (GTs); this is achieved by training an additional reverse network to translate the output back to the input simultaneously.
   - First, a labor-free structure library is prepared and set as the target domain for structure learning. Then a dual network is built with two generative adversarial networks (GANs); one is trained to translate a crack image patch (X) to a structural patch (Y), and the other is trained to translate Y back to X, simultaneously.
   - The experiments demonstrated that with such settings, the network can be trained to translate a crack image to the GT-like image with a similar structure pattern, and it can be used for crack detection. The proposed approach was validated on four crack data sets and achieved comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

   - we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions.

   - A convolutional autoencoder was trained as a reconstruction-based model, with the defect-free images, to rapidly and reliably detect defects from the large volume of image datasets. This training process was in the unsupervised mode, with no label needed, thereby requiring no prior knowledge and saving an enormous amount of time for label preparation.
   - The built anomaly detector favors minimizing the reconstruction errors of defect-free images, which renders high reconstruction errors of defects, in turn, detecting the location of defects. The assessment shows that the proposed anomaly detection technique is robust and adaptable to defects on wide ranges of scales.
