First, more than 40 papers of journal or top conference most published in the last three years are identified and collected based on the systematic literature review method. Second, according to the backbone network architecture of the models proposed in them, they are grouped into 10 topics: FCN, U-Net, encoder-decoder model, multi-scale, attention mechanism, transformer, two-stage detection, multi-modal fusion, unsupervised learning and weakly supervised learning, to be reviewed. Meanwhile, our survey focuses on discussing strengths and limitations of the models in each topic so as to reveal the latest research progress in the CIS field. Third, publicly accessible data sets, evaluation metrics, and loss functions that can be used for pixel-level crack detection are systematically introduced and summarized to facilitate researchers to select suitable components according to their own research tasks.

   - This study has identified the bigger picture of DL methods for crack identification in asphalt pavement. The authors evaluated several DL-based crack identification algorithms from the literature, such as crack classification, crack object detection, pixel-level crack segmentation, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for crack segmentation, and crack identification using unsupervised learning. Moreover, 26 DL-based crack detection models (25 supervised learning models and one unsupervised learning model) were analysed on the same dataset to test the performance of each model using consistent assessment metrics. The testing results suggest that ResNet and DenseNet are the best options for crack classification, while Faster R-CNN should be used for crack object detection and pix2pix is suggested for crack segmentation. It is also recommended that semi-supervised and unsupervised learning be further studied to efficiently detect cracks in an asphalt pavement.

## Datasets

1. **Automatic Crack Detection on Two-Dimensional Pavement Images: An Algorithm Based on Minimal Path Selection**, *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, 2016.  [[Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7572082)]

   - This paper proposes a new algorithm for automatic crack detection from 2D pavement images. It strongly relies on the localization of minimal paths within each image, a path being a series of neighboring pixels and its score being the sum of their intensities. The originality of the approach stems from the proposed way to select a set of minimal paths and the two postprocessing steps introduced to improve the quality of the detection.
   - An intensive validation is performed on both synthetic and real images (from five different acquisition systems), with comparisons to five existing methods.

## Learning Paradigms



### Supervised Learning

1. **Automated Pixel-Level Pavement Crack Detection on 3D Asphalt Surfaces Using a Deep-Learning Network**, *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering*, 2017.  [[Paper Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mice.12297)]

   - The CrackNet, an efficient architecture based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed in this article for automated pavement crack detection on 3D asphalt surfaces with explicit objective of pixel-perfect accuracy. Unlike the commonly used CNN, CrackNet does not have any pooling layers which downsize the outputs of previous layers.
   - The input data of the CrackNet are feature maps generated by the feature extractor using the proposed line filters with various orientations, widths, and lengths. The output of CrackNet is the set of predicted class scores for all pixels.

   - This paper proposes an improved architecture of CrackNet called CrackNet II for enhanced learning capability and faster performance. The proposed CrackNet II represents two major modifications on the original CrackNet.
   - First, the feature generator, which provides handcrafted features through fixed and nonlearnable procedures, is no longer used in CrackNet II. Consequently, all layers in CrackNet II have learnable parameters that are tuned during the learning process. Second, CrackNet II has a deeper architecture with more hidden layers but fewer parameters.
   - Compared with the original CrackNet, CrackNet II is capable of detecting more fine or hairline cracks, while eliminating more local noises and maintaining much faster processing speed.

   - In this paper, we propose DeepCrack-an end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural network for automatic crack detection by learning high-level features for crack representation. In this method, multi-scale deep convolutional features learned at hierarchical convolutional stages are fused together to capture the line structures
   - We build DeepCrack net on the encoder–decoder architecture of SegNet and pairwisely fuse the convolutional features generated in the encoder network and in the decoder network at the same scale

   - A recurrent neural network (RNN) called CrackNet-R is proposed in the article for fully automated pixel-level crack detection on three-dimensional (3D) asphalt pavement surfaces.  In the article, a new recurrent unit, gated recurrent multilayer perceptron (GRMLP), is proposed to recursively update the internal memory of CrackNet-R
   - CrackNet-R implements a two-phase sequence processing: sequence generation and sequence modeling. Sequence generation is specifically developed in the study to find the best local paths that are most likely to form crack patterns. Sequence modeling predicts timely probabilities of the input sequence being a crack pattern

During the training, the elaborately designed model learns and aggregates multi-scale and multi-level features from the low convolutional layers to the high-level convolutional layers, which is different from the standard approaches of only using the last convolutional layer

   - Our work proposes a weakly supervised approach that leverages a CNN classifier in a novel way to create surface crack pseudo labels. First, we use the classifier to create a rough crack localization map by using its class activation maps and a patch based classification approach and fuse this with a thresholding based approach to segment the mostly darker crack pixels. The classifier assists in suppressing noise from the background regions, which commonly are incorrectly highlighted as cracks by standard thresholding methods. Then, the pseudo labels can be used in an end-to-end approach when training a standard CNN for surface crack segmentation.
   - Our method is shown to yield sufficiently accurate pseudo labels.Those labels, incorporated into segmentation CNN training using multiple recent crack segmentation architectures, achieve comparable performance to fully supervised methods on four popular crack segmentation datasets.

   - this paper commits to improving the correlation between high-level semantics to low-level appearance.
   - A two-stage training manner with a segmentation refinement module for progressively refining pseudolabels and training the segmentation network was proposed. First, an activation modulation and recalibration scheme was recommended, which leverages a spotlight branch and a compensation branch to locate both the discriminative and less-discriminative object regions.
   - Then, the generated pseudolabels were used as supervision to train the segmentation network in the proposed two-stage manner. In the first stage, the network was pretrained to learn all essential information and provide a basic segmentation performance, aiming to facilitate network convergence in the following training. To develop the inference quality, in the second stage, the pretrained network was further trained recursively with the designed segmentation refinement module to improve the labels using two postprocessing algorithms between each iteration.

   - we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet.

Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions.

This training process was in the unsupervised mode, with no label needed, thereby requiring no prior knowledge and saving an enormous amount of time for label preparation.
   - The built anomaly detector favors minimizing the reconstruction errors of defect-free images, which renders high reconstruction errors of defects, in turn, detecting the location of defects. The assessment shows that the proposed anomaly detection technique is robust and adaptable to defects on wide ranges of scales.

   -  At the input level, foreground enhancement module (FEM) based on the contrast learning mechanism guides the crack detection model to focus on objects with similar structure features to the crack. Then, the feature distribution between different domains is aligned via adversarial learning, namely feature adaptation module (FAM). To further optimize the effect of domain adaptation, variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to align the clustered manifold structure of cracks on the output space, called output adaptation module (OAM).

   - This study proposes a novel self-training framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in the segmentation of concrete wall cracks using accumulated crack data. The proposed method incorporates Bayesian neural networks for uncertainty estimation of pseudo-labels, and spatial priors of cracks for screening noisy labels (Since cracks have unique shapes, calculating geometric features allows us to determine the validity of pseudo-labels. The key parameter characterizing cracks is area/perimeter2 due to their elongated shape.).
   - Furthermore, the integration of Stable Diffusion for few-shot image generation enhances domain adaptation performance by 0.0332. The proposed framework enables high-precision crack segmentation with as few as 100 target images, which can be easily obtained at the site, reducing the cost of model deployment in infrastructure maintenance.

   - Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings. However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes. In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.
   - we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to learn a unified illumination-invariant representation. Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem. In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set. Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes. CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.

   - This paper proposes a self-supervised structure learning network which can be trained without using paired data, even without using ground truths (GTs); this is achieved by training an additional reverse network to translate the output back to the input simultaneously.
   - First, a labor-free structure library is prepared and set as the target domain for structure learning. Then a dual network is built with two generative adversarial networks (GANs); one is trained to translate a crack image patch (X) to a structural patch (Y), and the other is trained to translate Y back to X, simultaneously.
   - The experiments demonstrated that with such settings, the network can be trained to translate a crack image to the GT-like image with a similar structure pattern, and it can be used for crack detection. The proposed approach was validated on four crack data sets and achieved comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

   - This study introduces a novel approach that fine-tunes SAM specifically for crack segmentation by incorporating low-rank adaptation (LoRA). This method involves adding a dedicated crack segmentation head to SAM, enabling automatic crack segmentation. Additionally, the application of LoRA technology facilitates the readjustment of SAM’s features without incurring the substantial costs typically associated with fine-tuning entire networks.
   - A comparative analysis with current leading crack segmentation models demonstrated a significant increase in accuracy across eight different crack datasets.

1. **Segment Any Crack: Deep Semantic Segmentation Adaptation for Crack Detection**, *Arxiv*, 2025.  [[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14138)]

   - This study introduces an efficient selective fine-tuning strategy, focusing on tuning normalization components, to enhance the adaptability of segmentation models for crack detection. The proposed method is applied to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and five well-established segmentation models. Experimental results demonstrate that selective fine- tuning of only normalization parameters outperforms full fine-tuning and other common fine-tuning techniques in both performance and computational efficiency, while improving generalization.
   - The proposed approach yields a SAM-based model, Segment Any Crack (SAC), achieving a 61.22% F1-score and 44.13% IoU on the OmniCrack30k benchmark dataset, along with the highest performance across three zero-shot datasets and the lowest standard deviation

   - Previous studies mainly focused on concrete structures and pavements, neglecting masonry defects and lacking publicly available datasets. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing the “MCrack1300” dataset, annotated for bricks, broken bricks, and cracks, targeting instance segmentation.
   - We propose two novel, automatically executable methods based on the latest visual large-scale model, the prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM). We fine-tune SAM’s encoder using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The first method connects SAM’s encoder to other decoders directly, while the second uses a learnable self-generating prompter. We modify the feature extractor for seamless integration of these methods with SAM’s encoder. Both methods outperform the state-of-the-art models, improving benchmark results approximately 3 % across all classes and around 6 % specifically for cracks
